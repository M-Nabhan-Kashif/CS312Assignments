Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.
The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.

Desalination Technologies: Design and Operation sets the scene for desalination technologies as a long-term solution to freshwater demand by analyzing the current demand for water, available water resources and future predicted demand. The book captures recent developments in thermal desalination (multistage flash desalination, multi-effect evaporation, vapor compression), membrane desalination (forward osmosis, reverse osmosis, pressure retarded, electrodialysis, membrane distillation, ultra-, nano-, and micro-filtration), and alternative processes such as freezing and ion exchange. Both dynamic and steady state models (from short cut, simple, to detail) of various desalination processes are discussed.
